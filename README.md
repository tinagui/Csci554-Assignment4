=================== <br>
Suggestions:
The administration page for a uers's band has been designed already.
It has six sections:
1. Editing Personal Information
2. Editing Music Style Information
3. Uploading Videos
4. Adding Personal Messages
5. Updating Profile Pictures
6. Editing "About" Information
We should create 6 individual pages that linked to the administration page for each editing section;
so that each feature won't interrupt with each other.
